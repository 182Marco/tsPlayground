# TypeScript Functional Programming Playground

## Getting Started

To run the project, you need to open **two terminal windows** and execute the following steps:

1. **Terminal 1**: Start the TypeScript compiler in watch mode to automatically compile `main.ts` from the `src` directory into `main.js` inside the `dist` folder. Run this command:

   ```bash
   npm run watch
   ```

2. **Terminal 2**: Launch nodemon on `main.js` inside the `dist` folder. This will allow you to see the output of your code directly in the terminal, with automatic restarts when changes are made. Run this command:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
